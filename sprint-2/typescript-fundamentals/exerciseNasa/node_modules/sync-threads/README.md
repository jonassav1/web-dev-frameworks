# sync-threads

Make asynchronous calls in Node.js synchronously using [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html) and [Atomics mutexes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics).

Especially useful when you need to resolve promises at require-time,
for example in an AWS Lambda function when using [provisioned concurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-concurrency.html#configuration-concurrency-provisioned).

NOTE: you don't need this library if you're happy with the overhead of creating a Node.js subprocess,
see the [Appendix](#appendix) for details.

# Example

This example shows how we can synchronously retrieve secrets from [AWS SSM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html)
at require-time – that is, before the init stage of Lambda has finished.

`index.js`:

```js
const { createSyncFn } = require('sync-threads')

// Create our synchronous function
const getSsmSecretSync = createSyncFn('./worker.js')

// Call it at init (require) time, no async needed!
const secret = getSsmSecretSync('/my-secret')

// Logged at init time
console.log({ secret, source: 'init' })

exports.handler = async () => {
  // This value can be used in our handler without needing to resolve anything async
  console.log({ secret, source: 'handler' })
}
```

`worker.js`:

```js
const SSM = require('aws-sdk/clients/ssm')
const { runAsWorker } = require('sync-threads')

const ssm = new SSM()

runAsWorker(async (ssmParamName) => {
  const {
    Parameter: { Value },
  } = await ssm.getParameter({ Name: ssmParamName, WithDecryption: true }).promise()
  return Value
})
```

You can see this example, as well as how you'd bundle it if you're using webpack or similar, in the [`examples`](./examples) directory.

# API

`sync-threads` exports two main functions: `createSyncFn` and `runAsWorker`

## `createSyncFn(filename[, bufferSize])`

Returns a synchronous function that will run the specified file as a worker, pass in any arguments you give it, and wait for the result.

### `runAsWorker(workerAsyncFn)`

To be called from inside your worker code. It will run the given asynchronous function with the given arguments from the parent and share the result.

# Installation

With [npm](http://npmjs.org/) do:

```
npm install sync-threads
```

# Appendix

You can achieve something very similar to this library using the
`spawnSync`/`execSync` functions from the `child_process` module in Node.js.

The main difference is that this library performs the async work in a thread, without creating a separate `node` process,
which makes it a little faster.

Here's a simple example of how you'd do it without needing this library:

`index.js`:

```js
const { execSync } = require('child_process')

const { secret } = JSON.parse(execSync('node worker.js /my-secret', 'utf8').trim().split('\n').pop())

console.log({ secret, source: 'init' })

exports.handler = async () => {
  console.log({ secret, source: 'handler' })
}
```

`worker.js`:

```js
const SSM = require('aws-sdk/clients/ssm')

const ssm = new SSM()

;(async () => {
  const {
    Parameter: { Value },
  } = await ssm.getParameter({ Name: process.argv[2], WithDecryption: true }).promise()
  console.log('%j', { secret: Value })
})()
```
